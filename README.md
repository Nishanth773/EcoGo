EcoGo: AI-Powered Eco-Routing SystemBy Team CODE CRAFTERS Optimizing Logistics for Fuel Efficiency, Carbon Reduction, and Transparency.
📌 Overview
It is an intelligent logistics solution designed to combat the high fuel consumption and $CO_{2}$ emissions in India's logistics sector. Unlike traditional navigation tools that prioritize speed or distance, ZYRH utilizes Explainable AI to recommend greener routes based on real-time traffic, terrain data, and vehicle-specific metrics.

🚀 Key FeaturesAl-Powered Eco-Routing: 
Optimizes delivery paths for fuel efficiency and time savings using real-time terrain and traffic data.Dynamic Sustainability Insights: Provides an EcoScore and detailed emission metrics to help managers make data-driven green choices.Explainable AI (XAI): Uses SHAP/LIME to provide transparent reasoning behind why a specific "green" route was chosen.Gamification (Driver Leaderboard): Encourages sustainable driving habits by rewarding drivers who achieve high EcoScores and $CO_{2}$ reduction targets.Unified Dashboard: A central interface for customers to track shipments and monitor environmental impact in real-time.🛠 

Tech StackFrontend & MobileFlutter: Cross-platform mobile application for drivers and customers.Leaflet: Used for the web-based interactive map dashboard.Backend & CloudNode.js & Express: Core REST API framework.Python (FastAPI/Flask): Powering the ML services and optimization engine.Firebase:Firestore: Real-time database for storing shipment and location data.Firebase Auth (JWT): Secure user authentication.Firebase Cloud Messaging: Notification layer for driver alerts.AWS Services: EC2 for hosting, S3 for data storage, and Lambda (Serverless).AI & Machine LearningOptimization Engine: Dijkstra, GraphHopper, and OR-Tools.ML Frameworks: TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for predicting fuel and emissions.NLP: BERT and Dialogflow for intelligent query handling.📐 ArchitectureThe ZYRH ecosystem is built on a modular architecture that connects mobile clients, AI services, and real-time data streams:Data Input: Real-time data is pulled from Google Maps API, Weather Data APIs, and Maritime Traffic Data APIs.Processing: The Optimization Engine and ML Service process this data to predict the best routes.Storage:
