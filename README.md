EcoGo is an intelligent logistics optimization platform designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions in India's transportation sector.


Unlike traditional navigation systems that prioritize the shortest distance or fastest route, EcoGo leverages Explainable AI (XAI) to recommend environmentally optimized routes based on:

Real-time traffic data
Terrain conditions
Weather inputs
Vehicle-specific metrics
Fuel consumption patterns
The system empowers logistics managers and drivers to make data-driven, sustainable decisions while maintaining operational efficiency.
